Simple K-Means Algorithm :

1. Choose the smallest possible K value possible.
	1a. Choose random k data points as centers from the Input data set.
	1b. Calculate distance from each center for each of the data point.
	1c. Group or Cluster data points to center with least distance. (Euclidean distance)
	1d. Compute New center from all the data points by cluster. (Mean)
	1e. Repeat steps 1b, 1c, 1d
		1f. Stop when there is no change in center or change from previous center is below 
		decided threshold value or when decided iterations count is reached.
2. Repeat steps 1a to 1f for next K value till maximum possible k value.
3. Choose k value and corresponding clustering based on the "Elbow theorem" after plotting SSE of all calculated K values.
